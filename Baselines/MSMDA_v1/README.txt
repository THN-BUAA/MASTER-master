MATLAB R2014a, 64bit operating system (the liblinear just only provides ".mexw64" files, you can remake these files according to the "\liblinear\README" file)

data.mat contains the data, name and the randmarks of 28 projects.


SRDO.m: Sparse Representation based Double Obfuscation algorithm, which requires l1_ls technique to solve l1-regularized optimization problem (or others l1-regularized optimization techniques).
The l1_ls algorithm can be downloaded from the URL of https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/l1_ls/.

Note we use LR classifier from LIBLINEAR, which is a library for
large-scale regularized linear classification and regression
(http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear). It is very easy to use
as the usage and the way of specifying parameters are the same as that
of LIBLINEAR.
